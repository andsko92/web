      <ol>
        <li>Bear in mind that you'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) 
          pages — such as the navigation menu, and the footer content.<br> 
          If your site is for a business, for example, it's a good idea to have 
          your contact information available in the footer on each page.<br> 
          Note down what you want to have common to every page.<br>
        <img src="../images/common-features.png" alt="common features">
        </li>
        <li>Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure 
          of each page to look like (it might look like our simple website above).<br> 
          Note what each block is going to be.<br>
        <img src="../images/site-structure.png" alt="site structure">
        </li>
        <li>Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content 
          you want to have on your website — write a big list down.<br>
        <img src="../images/feature-list.png" alt="feature list">
        </li>
        <li>Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, 
          to give you an idea of what parts might live together on different pages.<br> 
          This is very similar to a technique called Card sorting.<br>
        <img src="../images/card-sorting.png" alt="card sorting">
        </li>
        <li>Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for each page on your site,
          and draw lines to show the typical workflow between pages.<br> 
          The homepage will probably be in the center, and link to most 
          if not all of the others; most of the pages in a small site should be 
          available from the main navigation, although there are exceptions.<br> 
          You might also want to include notes about how things might be presented.<br>
